* ION PhysMem Driver

ION PhysMem is a simple and dumb driver that allows you to define ION Memory Manager heaps using 
device tree. This is mostly useful if your SoC has several 'special' regions (e.g. SRAM, 
dedicated memory banks, etc) are present in the physical memory map and require no extra care.

Example: 

#include <dt-bindings/ion,physmem.h>
...
	ion_im0: ion@0x00100000 { 
	     compatible = "ion,physmem";
	     reg = <0x00100000 0x40000>;
	     reg-names = "memory";
	     ion-heap-id   = <2>;
	     ion-heap-type = <ION_HEAP_TYPE_DMA>;
	     ion-heap-align = <0x10>;		     
	     ion-heap-name = "IM0";
	};
