Abstract
--------
EasyNMC driver is a very simple framework, that allows you to easily utilize 
NeuroMatrix DSP from linux userspace. It is loosely inspired by spufs, yet is
a big deal simpler in design.

Assumptions
-----------
The driver assumes that a DSP core: 
Has 3 interrupts from Host to NMC: 
NMI, HP, LP
Has 2 interrupts from NMC to Host:
HP, LP
Each core has a dedicated bunch of SRAM memory to run (at least startup code) 
from.

From userspace point of view
----------------------------
For each nmc core you get a /dev/nmcNio and /dev/nmcNmem, where N=0,1,2,...
and a set nmc-utils that allow you to deal with these devices. 
/dev/nmcNio is a stdio device. Think of it as of a oversimplified serial port.
You can read and write stdio data to your app, use select/epoll and friends, 
optionally reformatting string data for NMC. Before you can use /dev/nmcXio you 
should 'attach' circular buffers to this interface via ioctl. 
nmc-utils code does that automagically if it finds the corresponding sections in
your nmc app.


/dev/nmcNmem is a device that allows you to read, write and mmap NMC memory to
a userspace application. 
For the rest - a small set of ioctl's does the job and a small set of utils can 
use them from userspace. 
You can use select/poll to monitor incoming interrupts. POLLIN will report an LP, 
and POLLPRI will report an HP interrupt. This stuff is all EDGE-triggered. 
LP is reserved for stdio, so if you have stdio attached - you will NOT receive any
LP notifications via select/poll. 

But stdin/stdout and argc/argv is a thing of the past!
------------------------------------------------------
It is. Normally, for a high performance app you would avoid copying the data
over and over via the circular buffer and implement some kind of messagebox. 
The easynmc driver supports stdio as a very convenient for debugging and 
testing. It is absolutely optional.
If you want something better - grab libeasynmc and make your own data exchange
mechanism.

From kernel space
-----------------
No kernel-level API is provided at this time, apart from 
easynmc_register_core/easynmc_deregister_core. Not really needed at this time.

Utilities
---------
nmctl  - Control your NMC cores
nmrun  - Wrapper to run nmc application as if it was a userspace app
nmlog  - redirect stdin/stdout to a logfile/syslog/whatever, can be run as a daemon
